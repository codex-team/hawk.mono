# How to view Registry queues

This document describes how to view what queues we have in Registry and what tasks they have.

First of all, not that the Registry is actually RabbitMQ.

## 1. Open Rabbit MQ GUI

1. Go to http://localhost:15672 â€” the port can be learned from docker-compose.yml under `rabbitmq` section
2. Authorise using `guest:guest` pair

## 2. View available queues

They are listed under `Queues` tab
