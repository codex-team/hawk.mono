## Documentation

- [How to use hawk.mono to run local Hawk](docs/how-to-run-local-hawk.md)
- [How to send testing events to the local hawk](docs/how-to-get-events.md)
- [How to view Registry queues](docs/how-to-view-registry-queues.md)

## How to run

1. Run `git submodule init && git submodule update`.
2. Create `.env` file in those repositories where there is `.env.sample` file.
3. Run `docker-compose up` to run all hawk services or list only the necessary services in the command above.

## Troubleshooting

If something went wrong, check this items.

### /api dir is empty after using ./pull-all-submodules.sh

```
git submodule update --remote --merge
```

### `docker-compose up` failed

There can be a problems if docker has an outdated image or volume. You can try rebuild it.

#### Removing and image

Try this commands:

```bash
docker-compose build --no-cache <service>
```

service are  `garage` or `api` etc (see [docker-compose.yml](/docker-compose.yml) -> services)

If it does not help, remove docker image and build again:

1. List all images:

```bash
docker ps | grep hawk
```

2. Copy image name

3. Remove an image

```bash
docker image rm <name>
```

4. Rebuild

```bash
docker-compose up <service>
```

#### Removing a volume

```bash
docker volume ls
```

2. Find a volume you want to remove. For example, `hawkmono_api-deps` 

3. Remove volume

```
docker volume rm hawkmono_api-deps
```

4. Build

```bash
docker-compose build api
```
