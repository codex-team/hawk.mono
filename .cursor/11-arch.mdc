## Architecture (high level)

Hawk consists of:
- SDKs / Catchers (JS, Node.js, PHP, Python, etc.)
- API backend (event ingestion, processing, grouping) — GraphQL API
- Database (events, issues, users, projects) — MongoDB
- Garage — Web UI (dashboard, issues, charts, settings) — Vue.js 3
- Workers — Background tasks (email, Telegram, Slack notifications) — Node.js
- Collector — Entry point for all error events from client applications — Go
- Accounting — it is disabled and not used, do not use it in your code and memory

Some parts are split into separate repositories/packages but work as a single system.

Detailed description of the system architecture is in [docs/architecture.md](../docs/architecture.md).
