- Always use `UiButton` component for buttons.
- Always use `<script setup>` for components.
- Always use TypeScript for components.

## API calls

- Always use `api.call()` for API calls. Never use `api.callOld()`.
- API responses should be handled on Store (Vuex) level. Filter and handle errors there.

## Internationalization

- Always move all UI tokens to i18n.
- Always fill all translations in `messages/` files.
