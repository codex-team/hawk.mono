# Hawk — Project Overview

Hawk is an error monitoring and observability platform for applications and services.
It is an open-source.

Primary goals of Hawk:
- Collect, store, and analyze application errors
- Help teams detect regressions and production issues early
- Provide actionable context (stack traces, metadata, releases, environments)

## Mono-repository structure

This is a mono-repository consisting of the separate GitHub sub-repostories.
It is used for development purposes but also can be used to self-host Hawk.

## Architecture

See rules for architecture in `.cursor/11-arch.mdc`.

## Documentation

Detailed feature documentation lives in:
- `docs/` — source of truth for specs and flows

## When modifying code

Before making changes:
1. Identify which layer you are working in: Catcher(SDK), API, Garage, Workers, Collector
2. Check related documentation in root `docs/` directory or in the service's own `docs/` directory
3. Preserve existing public APIs unless explicitly instructed
