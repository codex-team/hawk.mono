description: Style rules for Hawk monorepo - always applied
alwaysApply: true
---

1. Write clean, readable code
2. Do not duplicate code blocks, reuse existing code if possible
3. Write simple yet straightforward comments to each logic block, function, class, propert, interface, constant, etc.
4. Always use block-style comments. Even for one liners.
6. Common types that are used across Garage / API / Workers / Catchers should be placed in [@hawk.so/types](../types) package.

## Classes

Do not create and export class instance in the same file where class is defined.
Create a separate file for the class instance and export it.

Do not do like that:

```typescript
export class MyClass {
  constructor() {
    // ...
  }
}

export const myClassInstance = new MyClass();
```

Do like that:

```typescript
export class MyClass {
  constructor() {
    // ...
  }
}
```

## TypeScript

- Do not cast types to `any` and `unknown`.
- Place private methods below public methods in classes.
